# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `p1_retail_db`



## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `p1_retail_db`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

E1. howmany sales we have?
```sql
select count(*) as total_retail_sales from retail_sales;
```
E2.howmany unique customers we have?
```sql
select count(distinct customer_id) as total_retail_sales from retail_sales;
```
E3.which all category we have?
```sql
select distinct category from retail_sales;
```
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

2. **Retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE  category = 'Clothing'
  AND DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m') = '2022-11'
  And quantity>=4;
```

3. **Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.**:
```sql
Select category,
		sum(total_sale) as net_sale,
        count(*) as total_orders
	from retail_sales
    group by category;
```

4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.**:
```sql
select
    round(avg(age),1) as average_age from retail_sales
where category='beauty';
```

5. **Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.**:
```sql
select * from retail_sales
where total_sale>1000;
```

6. **Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.**:
```sql
select
    category,
    gender, count(*) as total_transaction
from retail_sales
group by category,gender
order by 1;
```

7. **Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year**:
```sql
with best_sale_month as(select 
	year(sale_date) as year,
    month(sale_date)as month,
    round((total_sale),1) as avg_sales,
    rank() over(partition by year(sale_date) 
    order by avg(total_sale) desc) as ranks
from retail_sales
group by 1,2)
Select year,month,avg_sales from best_sale_month
where ranks = 1;
```

8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:
```sql
select
    distinct customer_id,
    sum(total_sale) as total_sales from retail_sales
group by 1
order by 2 desc
limit 5;
```

9. **Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.**:
```sql
select 
	category,
    count(distinct customer_id) unique_customers 
from retail_sales
group by category;
```

10. **Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**:
```sql
with total_order_in_shift as (
select *,
	case 
		when HOUR(sale_time) <= 12 then 'morning_shift'
        when HOUR(sale_time) between 12 and 17 then 'afternoon_shift'
        else 'evening'
	end as shift
from retail_sales
)
select 
	shift,
    count(*) as total_orders 
from total_order_in_shift
group by shift;
```

## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing,electronics and Beauty.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.

## Conclusion
